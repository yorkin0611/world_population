## Description
This repository was created as a part Google Data Analytics capstone project on Coursera. While the capstone was envisioned to be done with R language or Google Sheets, I opted for Python. The idea was to determine is there any correlation between birth rate drop and common social/financial factors, such as costs of living, health or education expenditures.<br>
Most of the central .ipynb notebook was done with `pandas` and `plotly.express` packages. File `labels.py` serves an auxiliary, home-brewed package containing dictionaries which are used to rename/replace various index and column names.<br>
Folder `imported_data` includes CSV files downloaded from Eurostat and "Our World in Data" web pages. #todo -> add DOI references.
Folder `exported_data` contains filtered/cleaned up data in various formats.
Notebook `try_outs.ipynb` served as a playground to test how various functions and methods in Python work.
